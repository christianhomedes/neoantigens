# neoantigens

Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM) is the most common and worst-prognosis neoplasia of the central nervous system, with a median survival of fewer than 14 months despite standard treatment: resection of the tumor as wide as possible, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy with temozolomide. Immunotherapy is being postulated as one of the most promising future therapies against cancer, and among them, the use of neoantigens as determinants to achieve an immune response against tumor cells, for example, with the generation of vaccines. The present work aims to predict and prioritize neoantigens in three specific cases based on the bulk RNA-seq of three patients and their tumor mutations in MAF and VCF format obtained from public databases. To do this, in the first stage, a mutational study was carried out to know the main genes and mutations involved in three patients diagnosed with GBM. Secondly, HLA typing was implemented with three software: OptiType, seq2HLA, arcasHLA, and a comparative study between them was achieved. Thirdly, a prediction of neoantigens was carried out with the software NetMHCpan EL 4.1, NetMHCpan BA 4.1, NetMHCcons, PickPocket, MHCflurry 2.0 using the tools MuPeXI, pVACseq (pVACtools) and the interface of the Immune Epitope Database (IEDB). The neoantigens have been prioritized according to their affinity for binding to HLA and the results have been compared between them. Finally, the neoantigens have been prioritized based on their tumor expression.
